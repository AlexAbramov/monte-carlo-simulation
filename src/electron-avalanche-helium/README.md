# Monte Carlo calculation of the parameters of an electron ensemble in helium in uniform electric fields

## Abstract

Computer experiments on simulating the motion of an ensemble of electrons in helium in uniform electric fields from 30 to 200 V(cmÂ·Torr) are performed. A zone is found in the discharge gap where the electron distribution function normalized to unity and the parameters averaged over it cease to depend on the position. The principal parameters of the electron ensemble (the mean energy, the drift velocity, the frequencies of processes, etc.) are calculated for this zone.
