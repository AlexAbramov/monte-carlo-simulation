# Self-consistent simulation of dark, normal and anomalous glow electric discharges using Monte-Carlo method

At the computer experiment you can observe the gas discharge evolution, the transitions from dark to normal and anomalous glow discharge and back. 
Also the program describes the cathode spot behaviour at the normal glow discharge.

Created by postgraduate student of Rostov State University Alexander Abramov.
